He is well-known for his repeated resistance against the forces of the Shu Kingdom, led by the renowned strategist Zhuge Liang. Meng Huo sought assistance from the ruler of 烏戈國 and gathered troops to bolster his efforts against the Shu forces. Throughout his campaigns, he engaged in strategic discussions with figures such as 兀突骨 to devise plans to counter Zhuge Liang's military tactics. Despite his efforts and several victories, Meng Huo was captured multiple times by Zhuge Liang, who chose to release him on each occasion.
