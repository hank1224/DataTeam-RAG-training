夫人失寵，郭貴妃欲謀為后，卻與幸臣張韜商議。時丕有疾，韜乃詐稱於甄夫人宮中掘得桐木偶人，上書天子年月日時，為壓鎮之事。丕大怒，遂將甄夫人賜死，立郭貴妃為皇后。因無出，養曹叡為己子。雖甚愛之，不立為嗣。\n\n叡年至十五歲，弓馬熟嫻。當年春二月，丕帶叡出獵。行於山塢之間，趕出子母二鹿，丕一箭射倒母鹿，回視小鹿，馳於曹叡馬前。丕大呼曰：「吾兒何不射之？」叡在馬上泣告曰：「陛下已殺其母，安忍復殺其子？」丕聞之，擲弓於地曰：「吾兒真仁德之主也！」於是遂封叡為平原王。\n\n夏五月，丕感寒疾，醫治不痊，乃召中軍大將軍曹真、鎮軍大將軍陳群、撫軍大將軍司馬懿三人入寢宮。丕喚曹叡至，指謂曹真等曰：「今朕病已沉重，不能復生。此子年幼，卿等三人，可善輔之，勿負朕心。」三人皆告曰：「陛下何出此言？臣等願竭力以事陛下，至千秋萬歲。」丕曰：「今年許昌城門無故自崩，乃不祥之兆，朕故自知必死也。」\n\n正言間，內侍奏征東大將軍曹休入宮問安。丕召入謂曰：「卿等皆國家柱石之臣也，若能同心輔朕之子，朕死亦瞑目矣！」言訖，墮淚而薨。時年四十歲，在位七年。於是曹真、陳群、司馬懿、曹休等，一面舉哀，一面擁立曹叡為大魏皇帝。謚父丕為文皇帝，謚母甄氏為文昭皇后。封鐘繇為太傅，曹真為大將軍，曹休為大司馬，華歆為太尉，王朗為司徒，陳群為司空，司馬懿為驃騎大將軍。其餘文武官僚，各各封贈。大赦天下。時雍，涼，二州缺人守把，司馬懿上表乞守西涼等處。曹叡從之，遂封懿提督雍，涼等處兵馬。領詔去訖。\n\n早有細作飛報入川。孔明大驚曰：「曹丕已死，孺子曹叡即位，餘皆不足慮，司馬懿深有謀略，今督雍、涼兵馬，倘訓練成時，深為蜀中之大患。不如先起兵伐之。」參軍馬謖曰：「今丞相平南方回，軍馬疲敝，只宜存恤，豈可復遠征？某有一計，使司馬懿自死於曹叡之手，未知丞相鈞意允\n######################\nOutput:",
