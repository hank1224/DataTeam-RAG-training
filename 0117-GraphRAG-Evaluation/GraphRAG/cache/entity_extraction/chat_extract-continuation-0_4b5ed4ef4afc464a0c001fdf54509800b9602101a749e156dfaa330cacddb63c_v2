帝以來，臨陣不退，遇敵則先，大丈夫得死於疆場者幸也，吾何恨焉，願為前部先鋒。」孔明再三苦勸不從。雲曰：「如不教我為先鋒，就撞死於階下！」孔明曰：「將軍既要為先鋒，須得一人同去。」\n\n言未盡，一人應曰：「某雖不才，願助老將軍先引一軍前去破敵。」孔明視之，乃鄧芝也。孔明大喜，即撥精兵五千，副將十員，隨趙雲、鄧芝去訖。孔明出師，後主引百官送於北門外十里。孔明辭後主，旌旗蔽野，戈戟如林，率軍望漢中迤邐進發。\n\n卻說邊庭探知此事，報入洛陽。是日曹叡設朝，近臣奏曰：「邊官報稱：諸葛亮率大兵三十餘萬，出屯漢中，令趙雲、鄧芝為前部先鋒，引兵入境。」叡大驚，問群臣曰：「誰可為將，以退蜀兵？」忽一人應聲而出曰：「臣父死於漢中，切齒之恨，未嘗得報。今蜀兵犯境，臣願引本部猛將，更乞陛下賜關西之兵，前往破蜀。上為國家效力，下報父讎，臣萬死不恨！」\n\n眾視之，乃夏侯淵之子夏侯楙也。楙字子休﹔其性最急，又最吝。自幼嗣與夏侯惇為子。後夏侯淵為黃忠所斬，曹操憐之，以女清河公主招楙為駙馬，因此朝中欽敬。雖掌兵權，未嘗臨陣。當時自請出征，曹叡即命為大都督，調關西諸路軍馬前去破敵。\n\n司徒王朗奏曰：「不可。夏侯駙馬素不曾經戰，今付以大任，非其所宜。更兼諸葛亮足智多謀，深通韜略，不可輕敵。」夏侯楙曰：「司徒莫非結連諸葛亮，欲為內應耶？吾自幼從父學習韜略，深通兵法，汝何欺我年幼？吾若不生擒諸葛亮，誓不回見天子！」\n\n王朗等皆不敢言。夏侯楙辭了魏主，星夜到長安，調關西諸路軍馬二十餘萬，來敵孔明。正是：欲秉白旄麾將士，卻教黃吻掌兵權。未知勝負如何，且看下文分解。\n######################\nOutput:",
